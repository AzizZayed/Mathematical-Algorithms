# Mathematical-Algorithms
These are a bunch of math related algorithms. Always more to come. Tutorials on YouTube for some of these.

<u>This repo contains</u>:

* **_BaseConverter_**: This class uses an algorithm to convert any number in any base to a decimal number (base 10).


* **_FactorialCalculator_**: This class uses common algorithms to compute the factorial of a number such as iterative and resursive algorithms. There is also a bonus, big factorial, this function uses strings to compute the factorial of massive numbers that would cause [_overflow_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) if stored in integers or longs. Video on iterative factorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA8C23gdBAQ&list=PL7g8l3pNV7-Yf01lequm7hw9MEpOGJ-o2&index=2&t). Video on recursive factorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXZ7b_C-vv0&list=PL7g8l3pNV7-Yf01lequm7hw9MEpOGJ-o2&index=3&t).


* **_Factorizer_**: This class uses several algorithms to compute the composite and [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) factors of any number, the common factors of 2 numbers and the greatest common factor and the least common multiple of 2 numbers. 

* **_FibonacciSequence_**: This class uses common iterative and recursive algorithms to compute the fibonacci sequence. There is also a bonus algorithm, it computes thousands of digit-long fibonacci numbers stored in a string.

* **_FibonacciSequencePlus_**: This class uses memoization and dynamic programming techniques to compute the fibonacci sequence.

* **_SequenceGenerator_**: This class containes algorithms that compute miscellaneous sequences like prime & composite number sequences, [triangular number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) sequences and [pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple).

Every class has a main method so you can test the code. I invite anyone learning these algorithms to tweak and optimize them as they are not all at maximum efficiency. Feel free to leave a comment on my [website](https://www.coding-heaven.ml/) if you wish to share your changes to this code.
